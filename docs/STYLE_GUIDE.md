## 🎨 Design System (Visual Identity)

### Brand Foundations
*   **Personality**: Strict, Clean, Professional, High Contrast, Fluid.
*   **Core Principle**: **"No Sharp Corners"**. Every interactive element must be rounded (min 12px), and every container must use large radii (24px+).
*   **Aesthetic**: Premium, app-like feel with subtle micro-interactions and soft shadows.

### Color Palette
| Token | HEX | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary** | `#FF4D22` | Buttons, links, primary branding, active states. |
| **Primary Hover** | `#E63E15` | Button hover states. |
| **Primary Light** | `#FFEDEA` | Subtle backgrounds, notification highlights. |
| **Foreground** | `#0A0A0A` | Headings, primary text. |
| **Background** | `#FFFFFF` | Page backgrounds (Light Mode). |
| **Dark Mode BG** | `#000000` | Business Landing Page roots. |

### Typography
*   **Font Family**: `DM Sans` (Google Font).
*   **Heading 1**: 7xl (mobile: 3xl) | Bold | Tight tracking | Leading 1.1.
*   **Body Text**: 18px / 16px | Medium weight | Relaxed leading.
*   **Rules**: Never use serif fonts. Keep spacing generous.

### Layout & Spacing
*   **Container Radius**: `rounded-3xl` (1.5rem / 24px) for cards and sections.
*   **Interactive Radius**: `rounded-xl` or `rounded-2xl` for buttons and inputs.
*   **Padding**: Default to 24px (1.5rem) or 32px (2rem) for card contents.
*   **Shadows**: Use soft, diffused shadows (`shadow-xl`) for hovered cards; avoid harsh borders.

## ✍️ Tone of Voice (Copywriting)

### Core Positioning
Connex is a **tool for results**, not an ad agency or a generic influencer marketplace.

### Brand Pillars
1.  **Simplicity**: No admin friction. No middle-men.
2.  **Control**: Businesses choose exactly who they work with; Creators choose what they create.
3.  **Transparency**: Clear deliverables. measurable ROI.
4.  **Value Exchange**: "Lifestyle as currency" for creators; "Outcome-based growth" for businesses.

### The "No-Go" List (Anti-Patterns)
*   **❌ Don't say**: "Influencer marketing", "Ad platform", "Agency style", "Campaign management".
*   **✅ Say**: "Niche creators", "Direct collaboration", "Results over friction", "Real ROI".

### Key Taglines
*   *For Business*: **"More Results. Less Friction."**
*   *For Creators*: **"Your Lifestyle. Your Currency."**
*   *General*: **"Outcomes, not impressions."**
